          A software engineer currently based in the Greater Vancouver Area in
          Canada. Software Engineering has taught me a lot about how to get
          things done and life in general as well. I am also interested in a
          host of other things, from science and spirituality to sports and
          comedy. For professional information, check the{" "}

          Well, that covers almost everything! ðŸ˜º The thing is, if you care to
          find the beauty behind any thing, you will start to appreciate it.
          You also have to seek (and share) guidance to balance your thoughts
          and keep your biases in check.
